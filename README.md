# Stock Market Report System
This system fetches stock market data, generates analysis reports, and sends them to users via email on a daily basis.

## Project Overview
This workflow fetches stock market data using the Alpha Vantage API, processes it with a Python script, and sends an HTML-based stock market analysis report to users via email using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES). The Python script is containerized using Docker, uploaded to Amazon ECR, and executed using AWS Lambda. The Lambda function is triggered daily by Amazon EventBridge. Amazon DynamoDB stores recipient email addresses, and Amazon CloudWatch monitors the execution of the script.
Architecture Overview


Components

Alpha Vantage API: Source of stock market data.
Python Script:

Fetches stock data from Alpha Vantage
Retrieves user email addresses from DynamoDB
Generates HTML report


Docker: Contains the Python script and its dependencies.
Amazon ECR: Hosts the Docker image.
AWS Lambda: Runs the Docker image.
Amazon EventBridge: Triggers the Lambda function daily at 8 AM ET.
Amazon DynamoDB: Stores user email addresses.
Amazon SES: Sends email notifications with HTML reports.
Amazon CloudWatch: Logs metrics and monitors the system.

Project Setup
1. Prerequisites
AWS Account: For setting up AWS services (Lambda, DynamoDB, SES, EventBridge, CloudWatch, etc.).
Alpha Vantage API Key: To retrieve stock market data.
Docker: To containerize the Python script.
2. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
3. Python Script
The script fetches stock data, generates an HTML report, and sends emails via SES.

4. AWS Setup
Lambda: Create a Lambda function using a Docker image.
ECR: Upload your Docker image to Amazon ECR.
SES: Verify email addresses and set up SES to send reports.
DynamoDB: Store recipient email addresses.
EventBridge: Schedule the Lambda function to run daily.
5. Dockerize the Script
bash
Copy code
docker build -t stock-market-analysis .
docker tag stock-market-analysis:latest <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/stock-market-analysis:latest
docker push <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/stock-market-analysis:latest
6. Deploy to AWS
Lambda: Deploy the Docker image to Lambda.
EventBridge: Set up a daily trigger.
7. Monitoring
Use CloudWatch to log and monitor the Lambda function's execution.
Workflow

EventBridge triggers the Lambda function every morning at 8 AM ET.
Lambda runs the Docker image containing the Python script.
The script fetches stock data from Alpha Vantage API.
User email addresses are retrieved from DynamoDB.
The script generates an HTML report with stock market analysis.
Amazon SES sends the HTML report to users via email.
CloudWatch logs the activities and monitors the system.

Setup and Deployment
(Add instructions for setting up and deploying the system, including necessary AWS configurations)
Configuration
(Add details about any configuration files or environment variables needed)
Monitoring and Logging
The system uses Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging. Check the CloudWatch dashboard for:

Lambda function execution logs
EventBridge trigger status
SES email sending status
